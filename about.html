              Students are moving to online education and the resources available are spread way too thin. 28% of students now take at least 1 distance education/online course. Only 41.9% of teachers even knew about open online educational resources in some capacity. According to statistica.com online resources are found to be helpful by 81% of students. Online resources are not tailored to individual learning styles of students, and should be updated to meet the needs of the current generation of students.
